# Project status

**Last updated:** 2026-04-25

**Current phase:** Phase 11 stabilized and user-validated complete; ready for Phase 12 QA/polish

**API notes:**
- **`POST /api/resume/analyze`** is wired to the real `agents.resume_scorer.analyze_resume_and_jd` (PDF or text/Markdown upload or pasted `resume_text`, plus `jd_url` and/or `jd_text`). It is no longer a fixed mock score.
- **`POST /api/generate/answer`** expects JSON body **`AnswerRequest`**: required **`question`**; at least one of **`jd_text`** / **`jd_url`**; optional **`profile`** (`UserProfile` nested **inside** `profile`, not at root). Omit `profile` to use the server mock profile. Do not use OpenAPI placeholder **`"string"`** for URLs or dates — use real values or JSON **`null`**.

## Phases (PRD Section 21)

Complete Phase N before starting Phase N+1. Update this file and `Agent_Status.md` after each phase.

- [x] **Phase 1** — Repo scaffold (folder structure, env templates, status files)
- [x] **Phase 2** — Supabase + auth (backend): Python client, JWT middleware, protected routes, health + verification scripts. *Dashboard:* migrations, RLS, `resumes` bucket per [docs/setup-external-services.md](docs/setup-external-services.md) if not already applied. *Automated checks:* `cd backend` → `python verify_db.py` → `python verify_phase2.py` → `python -m pytest tests/ -v`.
- [x] **Phase 3** — Pydantic schemas + unit tests (`backend/schemas/*`, `backend/tests/unit/test_schemas.py`). *Check:* `python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_schemas.py -v`. *Deps:* `pydantic[email]` in `backend/requirements.txt` for `EmailStr`.
- [x] **Phase 4** — FastAPI routes (full mock data), structured logging, CORS, `GET /api/health` (DB + LLM ping), Pydantic response models, `JsonHttpError` for PRD-shaped 422s, `middleware/logging.py` → stdout + `backend/logs/app.log`
- [x] **Phase 5** — Scraper & PDF parser tools
- [x] **Phase 6** — Gemini LLM service
- [x] **Phase 7** — Resume scorer agent
- [x] **Phase 8** — Answer generator agent
- [x] **Phase 9** — Autofill agent
- [x] **Phase 9.5** — Autofill postmortem, privacy scrub, and execution-path reset
- [x] **Phase 10** — Frontend static UI with mock data
- [x] **Phase 11** — Auth + frontend integration
- [ ] **Phase 12** — QA, polish & docs

## Notes

- **Phase 2 (backend) done:** `settings.py` loads `backend/.env` then repo root `.env`. `services/supabase.py`, `middleware/auth.py` (`verify_jwt`, `get_current_user`), all protected routes under `/api`, `verify_db.py` / `verify_phase2.py` for acceptance checks.
- **Phase 4 (backend) done:** Routers return PRD-shaped mocks with `response_model` from `schemas/`; `StructuredLoggingMiddleware` (JSON lines); `services/llm.check_llm_reachable()` for health when `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set; `exceptions.JsonHttpError` for flat JSON errors on resume validation.
- **Phase 5 (backend tools) done:** Implemented `tools/scraper.py` (`scrape_job_description`, `scrape_form_fields`) with `httpx` + `BeautifulSoup` (selector fallbacks, cleaned text, graceful failures, normalized `FormField` output) and `tools/pdf_parser.py` (`extract_text_from_pdf`) with `PyMuPDF` handling empty/scanned/invalid PDFs safely. Added deterministic unit tests in `tests/unit/test_scraper.py` and `tests/unit/test_pdf_parser.py`; verification command passed: `python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_scraper.py backend/tests/unit/test_pdf_parser.py -v`.
- **Phase 6 (backend llm service) done:** Implemented `services/llm.py` production-ready helpers for `load_prompt`, `call_gemini`, optional `call_groq`, and `parse_json_from_response`, including structured errors (`LLMError`, `JSONParseError`, `PromptLoadError`), safe prompt-path loading, timeout/model env handling (`GEMINI_MODEL`, `LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`), and graceful health integration via `check_llm_reachable()`. Added unit tests in `tests/unit/test_llm_service.py`; verification command passed: `python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_llm_service.py backend/tests/unit/test_schemas.py -v`.
- **Phase 7 (resume scorer agent) done:** Implemented `agents/resume_scorer.py` full PRD flow for `analyze_resume_and_jd(resume_source, jd_source, user_id)` with source resolution (PDF/text + URL/text), expected structured agent failures (`pdf_no_text`, `jd_scrape_failed`, `resume_too_short`, `jd_too_short`), input truncation guards, prompt loading via `resume_score_v1.txt`, Gemini invocation, JSON parsing + `ResumeScoreResult` validation, and one retry using a correction prompt on JSON/schema failure. Added logging hooks (agent_name, user_id, duration_ms, score, token placeholders, success/failure) and targeted unit tests in `tests/unit/test_resume_scorer.py`; verification command passed: `python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_resume_scorer.py -v`.
- **Resume analyze route:** `backend/routers/resume.py` calls the scorer agent (not mock data). Uploads: `.pdf` or magic bytes `%PDF` → PDF extraction; other files (e.g. `.md`, `.txt`) → UTF-8/Latin-1 text. If both `jd_url` and `jd_text` are sent, **URL is used** (scraped JD). Requires auth (`Authorization: Bearer`); use `python backend/mint_dev_jwt.py` locally.
- **Phase 8 (answer generator) — reliability & length (see `Agent_Status.md` for full issue log):** `generate_tailored_answer` uses Gemini first, Groq second, deterministic fallback only on serious LLM outage codes. Word limits: default max **300** (`ANSWER_MAX_WORDS` env override); optional **“N words”** in the question adjusts min/max. Regeneration retries for `answer_too_short`, `answer_too_long`, and quality failures. `LAST_PROVIDER_USED` / `LAST_WORD_LIMIT_MAX` and log field `llm_provider` record which backend succeeded. Prompt `answer_gen_v1.txt` targets 220–280 words. `call_gemini(..., expect_json=False)` for prose (JSON mime type was breaking non-JSON answers). Smoke script `backend/scripts/smoke_answer_gen.py` prints provider + limits.
- **Phase 9 (autofill mapper) done:** Implemented `agents/autofill_mapper.py` with PRD flow: `map_fields_to_profile(page_url, user_profile)` scrapes fields via `tools.scraper.scrape_form_fields`, applies high-confidence rule map first (`FIELD_MAP`, confidence `0.95`), sends only unmapped fields to LLM fallback using `load_prompt("autofill_v1.txt")` + `call_gemini` + `parse_json_from_response/json fallback`, merges results, computes confidence bands (`auto_fill` >= 0.85, `suggest` 0.50–0.84, `unknown` < 0.50), returns `AutofillResult`, and raises structured `AgentError("no_fields_detected", ...)` for empty pages. Router `POST /api/autofill` now calls the agent (replacing mock) with Phase 7/8-style error mapping/logging (`422` for expected `AgentError`, `503` for `LLMError`). Added `backend/tests/unit/test_autofill.py` including mocked HTTP scrape and mocked LLM JSON fallback; verification passed: `python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_autofill.py -v` (4 passed). Manual sanity attempt: Greenhouse/Indeed public links were mostly non-apply or blocked pages in this environment, so observed fill-rate is not representative of true apply forms; use known live apply URLs during QA for target `fill_rate > 0.5`.
- **Phase 9 hardening (ATS + profile quality):** Addressed major real-world autofill failures from Ashby/Oracle/Workday with layered scraper recovery (`static -> rendered -> interactive Playwright DOM`), session-aware progression clicks (`Apply/Continue/Next`), iframe/shadow-root extraction, low-signal guardrails, and stronger diagnostics (`ats_page_not_ready` vs `no_fields_detected`). Added interactive retry in mapper when first pass fails expected ATS errors. Hardened LLM fallback parsing to degrade gracefully on malformed JSON instead of failing whole requests. Added optional request-body `profile` override for `/api/autofill` and expanded profile schema + mappings for address-grade fields (`address_line1/2`, `city`, `province/state`, `country`, `postal/zip`) with updated defaults for current user profile data. Validation and smoke outcomes are logged in `Agent_Status.md` rows #16–#17 and Phase 9 reference section.
- **Phase 9.5 postmortem (requested reset):** Autofill mapping quality improved, but true "live fill" reliability remained below bar because backend Playwright runs in a separate session and cannot consistently share the user's authenticated in-browser state (especially Workday-style auth gates and multi-step dynamic forms). This created repeated UX friction despite extraction gains. Privacy cleanup completed: personal literals removed from tracked code/tests; local-only profile remains in gitignored `backend/routers/mock_profile_private.py`. Product direction is now explicit:
  - Keep backend autofill as **mapping + scoring + diagnostics**.
  - Implement real **in-browser execution** via extension/content script (same session as user).
  - Load profile from persisted source first (not hardcoded fallback), with clear auth/session state.
  - Ship Phase 10 UI as stable preview/control plane, then Phase 11 integration for website + extension handoff.
- **Phase 10 (frontend static control plane) done:** Replaced placeholder app pages with functional static UX in `frontend/` using typed contracts and mock adapters aligned to backend payloads. Added `(app)` shell navigation + shared state container (`context/phase10-app-context.tsx`), profile editor with address fields and visible work/education sections, autofill preview workspace with diagnostics (`no_fields_detected`, `ats_page_not_ready`, `low_confidence`) and per-field override editing, application tracker dashboard with status/history/notes, and jobs action panel with explicit split between “Run mapping” and “Open extension to execute fill.” Added typed service stubs (`services/api.ts`) and centralized mock datasets (`lib/phase10-mock-data.ts`) as temporary Phase 10 data sources to be swapped in Phase 11. Frontend validation passed (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`) after strict TS fix in profile field typing.
- **Phase 11 (auth + integration + extension bridge) done:** Replaced static Phase 10 adapters with authenticated API client wrappers in `frontend/services/api.ts` using Supabase session Bearer tokens and robust error handling (`ApiError`, config guards, 401 flow handling). Reworked `frontend/context/phase10-app-context.tsx` to load real profile/applications from `/api/users/me` + `/api/applications`, run real mapping preview via `/api/autofill`, persist profile updates to `/api/users/me`, persist application notes to `/api/applications/{id}`, and ingest extension telemetry into tracker state. Updated UI semantics explicitly to “Run mapping preview” vs “Execute fill in browser tab.” Added login/register session flows and root auth redirect (`frontend/app/page.tsx`, auth pages, app layout sign-out). Added shared typed bridge contracts in `frontend/types/extension-bridge.ts` and extension MVP skeleton in `extension/` (manifest, background worker, content script, popup/options, bridge README). Security hardening note: bridge auth context stored in `chrome.storage.session` rather than persistent local storage. Validation passed: `npm run lint`, `npm run build`; backend endpoint checks passed for `/api/users/me`, `/api/applications`, and live URL mapping previews (`/api/autofill` on `https://httpbin.org/forms/post` returned non-zero fields/mappings).
- **Phase 11 stabilization (2026-04-25) done:** Closed all major post-integration blockers from live usage and debugging:
  - **False “backend unreachable” masking fixed:** frontend fallback path no longer hides real backend API failures as generic fetch errors; API base normalization now consistently handles `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`.
  - **Profile save fixed (backend 500):** Supabase `users` table was missing address columns in schema cache (`address_line1`, `address_line2`, `city`, `province`, `country`, `postal_code`); columns added and update handler hardened for PostgREST missing-column cache errors.
  - **Mark complete fixed (backend 500):** `PATCH /api/applications/{id}` crashed on non-JSON-serializable `date_applied` (`date` object); update payload now uses JSON-safe serialization (`model_dump(..., mode="json")`).
  - **Dashboard/Jobs Applied UX finalized per user request:** restored dashboard KPI cards, dashboard top-10 recent jobs, Jobs Applied all jobs with 20-per-page pagination, unified columns (`Company`, `Role`, `Link`, `Status`, `Date Applied`, `Letter Score`), and correct status/score propagation between views.
  - **Resume score report persistence completed:** added `application_score_reports` storage + RLS migration (`supabase/migrations/008_application_score_reports.sql`), backend endpoints (`GET/PUT /api/applications/{id}/score-report`), and Jobs Applied **View Report** action.
  - **Extension fill quality improved:** strengthened content-script semantic guardrails and candidate scoring to reduce cross-field fills (email/phone/address/city/postal mismatches) on ATS forms.
  - **User-validated result:** profile save + mark complete now working, status flow working, and phase accepted as complete with only potential minor ATS-specific mapping refinements.

## Phase 9.5: Failure Log and Forward Plan

### What went wrong
- Backend-only execution was treated like live browser autofill, but session/auth context did not match user browser reality.
- ATS auth gates and multi-step flows caused repeated false starts even when extraction succeeded.
- Iteration velocity on fixes was high, but confidence for "works every time in real apply flow" stayed low.
- Personal test data appeared in tracked files during debugging and had to be scrubbed.

### What is now stable
- Field extraction is materially stronger (static + rendered + interactive + iframe/shadow traversal).
- Mapper confidence bands and diagnostics are useful for UI surfacing and manual correction.
- Structured error taxonomy exists (`no_fields_detected`, `ats_page_not_ready`, etc.).
- Personal data is now restricted to local gitignored override file.

### What user wants (explicit target)
- Open jobs in browser and have autofill **actually fill** in live pages, not just preview mappings.
- Use extension + website together: website as dashboard/control plane, extension as in-page executor.
- Track applications end-to-end (status, history, notes, follow-ups) with minimal manual duplication.
- Robust auth/profile loading so user context is ready by default across sessions/devices.

### Execution plan from here
- Phase 10: static frontend that mirrors real workflows (dashboard, autofill preview, profile, app tracker).
- Phase 11: auth + profile persistence integration first, then extension bridge for in-page fill execution.
- Extension architecture: content script detects fields, requests mappings from backend, applies fills in current authenticated tab, and returns per-field success/failure telemetry.

### Phase 11 integration focus (next)
- Replace Phase 10 mock adapters with authenticated API fetches for profile, applications, and mapping runs.
- Source logged-in profile from backend user context (local dev private overrides in `backend/routers/mock_profile_private.py`), not hardcoded frontend mocks.
- Introduce extension bridge contract/events so mapping previews and in-tab execution telemetry share one state model.
- Keep extension code isolated from `frontend/` in a separate root folder (e.g. `extension/`) while sharing typed contracts where needed.

### Phase 4 verification issues and fixes (for future reference)

- **PowerShell `uvicorn` not found:** `uvicorn` command was not on PATH.  
  **Fix:** run `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload` from `backend/`.
- **Wrong directory (`backend/backend`) error:** running `cd backend` while already inside `backend`.  
  **Fix:** check prompt path first; run server directly if already in `...\backend`.
- **`/` returning `{"detail":"Not Found"}`:** no root route existed, only `/api/*`.  
  **Fix:** added `GET /` in `main.py` with links to `/docs`, `/openapi.json`, and `/api/health`.
- **401 in Swagger despite valid JWT:** `Authorization` header was not consistently sent from `/docs` with plain header dependency.  
  **Fix:** switched auth dependency to `HTTPBearer` in `middleware/auth.py` so `/docs` Authorize works correctly.
- **JWT confusion (`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` vs Bearer token):** API keys were being treated like user JWTs.  
  **Fix:** documented distinction and added `backend/mint_dev_jwt.py` for local Bearer token generation.
- **`llm: error` in health + SDK warning:** health ping failed and `google.generativeai` showed deprecation warning.  
  **Fix:** default model changed to `gemini-2.5-flash` with `GEMINI_MODEL` override; warning is non-blocking for Phase 4 and migration to `google.genai` is tracked for Phase 6.

### Phase 8 answer generator — problems and fixes (summary)

| Problem | What happened | Fix |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| Prose answers broken / empty | Gemini was called with JSON-only response settings for all paths | `expect_json=False` for answer generation; JSON mime only when parsing structured output |
| `answer_too_short` / flaky quality | Single-shot generation, 503/504 from Gemini | Retries inside provider; Groq as second provider; deterministic template only on `llm_unavailable` / `llm_empty_response` after both fail |
| Groq not used | Env key not read from `Settings` | `groq_api_key` on settings + `call_groq` reads env and settings |
| Answers too long for recruiters | No upper bound | Hard validation `answer_too_long`, rewrite prompts, `_MAX_TOKENS` ≈ 480, prompt cap 300 words |
| Unknown which model served smoke | No observability | `llm_provider` in logs; module globals + smoke script output |
| `test_llm_service` mock outdated | Refactor renamed `_build_gemini_model` → `_build_gemini_clients` | Test patches `_build_gemini_clients` with legacy-branch fake |

### Integration & API correctness + Gemini fallback (2026-04-20)

Logged as **`Agent_Status.md` row #14** and **Phase 8 reference items §8–§14** (same file). Summary for commit / handoff:

| Area | Issue | Resolution |
|------|--------|------------|
| **`schemas/user.py` — `WorkHistoryItem`** | Swagger default `"string"` for dates caused 422 (`start_date` / `end_date` must be YYYY-MM). | `mode="before"` coercion: `YYYY-MM-DD` → `YYYY-MM`; `end_date` placeholders → `null`; clear error on bad `start_date` mentioning Swagger. |
| **`POST /api/generate/answer`** | Profile JSON sent at **root** → missing `question`, `extra_forbidden` on all profile keys. | Body must be `{ question, jd_text?, jd_url?, profile? }`. |
| **JSON body** | `json_invalid` / “Expecting ',' delimiter” near EOF. | Add **closing `}`** for root after `profile`’s `}`; no trailing commas; ASCII `"` only. |
| **`jd_url`** | Literal `"string"` from docs. | Use `null` or omit when using pasted `jd_text` only. |
| **Gemini `503`** | User doubt: local machine vs Google. | **`503` / high-demand messages are Google-side capacity**, not the dev PC; keep Groq + retries. |
| **`services/llm.py` + `settings.py`** | Fallback `gemini-2.0-flash` returned **404** for new API keys after primary **503**. | Default **`GEMINI_MODEL_FALLBACK=gemini-2.5-flash-lite`**; `_extend_gemini_model_chain` appends Flash-Lite when chain still contains `gemini-2.0-flash*`; **`_gemini_retryable`** includes **`NO LONGER AVAILABLE`** so 404 advances the chain. `.env.example` updated. |
| **`resume/analyze` multipart** | `-F resume_text=string` with PDF. | Omit or use real pasted text — not the placeholder word `string`. |
| **Tests** | Regression coverage for above. | `test_schemas.py` (dates + Swagger message); `test_llm_service.py` (overload retry, deprecated 2.0 → lite chain). **47** `tests/unit` passing at last run. |
